1. See how xi changes if data IR changes. 
Use k-fold cv to find the best xi. Use some balanced data sets to get different degree of rarity (IR).
Seems the best xi not just depends on the IR but also on the data. That's suck...now it's hard to get empirical rule.
2. Figure out whether we can find out the best xi by some algs, like gene-alg? 
It's hopeless to use derivative method...cause we can't get the primitive function of the link, and so we can't get the loss function. No way to derivative.
3. Does HighDimAlg work? 
At least ordinal scheme doesn't work. Random scheme may be promising, but seems not better than pure GLS.
4. How does the whole procesure look like? 
We use GLS to get fine-tune parameters (xi, reg) and then use HDA? Or we directly use HDA to get the best fitting?
5. However, in the first place, does GLS work for imbalanced data? 
The link function's asymmetry is true but what about the loss? The combination of them can really handle imbalanced data?
6. Is there any other ways to do the Gen() process in HDA rather than just random sample? 
Must be fast, not much calculation. What is Fourier Random Feature?
7. How do the parameters (patchSize, kTimes) affect the result in HDA? 
Larger is better?
8. Compare to normal classification algs such as LogisticRegression and RandomForest.
9. Compare to other techniques for imbalanced data such as down-sizing, oversampling and other methods.
